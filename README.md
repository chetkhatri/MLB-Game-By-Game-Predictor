# MLB-Game-By-Game-Predictor (NOT COMPLETED YET)

This is similar to one of my other projects (https://github.com/adeshpande3/MLB_Win_Predictor) where I used ML to predict the number of wins that a team would get over the course of a season based on certain statistics such as Runs, Batting Average, RBIs, etc. The model performed well, as it was able to predict the team's total within 3 games. However, in terms of applications, the model is lacking because it is only able to make a prediction with that particular season's data (e.g If I wanted to predict how many wins the Dodgers get in 2017, I would need their RBI totals, ERA totals, etc for 2017).

This model seeks to find out what statistics impact the outcome of a matchup between two teams most significantly. Given information about 2 MLB teams (information represented through a vector), we want to train a model that outputs the probability that Team 1 will win the matchup. This model will be trained on historical game by game data to analyze what input features have the most impact on the overall result.
